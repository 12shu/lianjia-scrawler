# lianjia-scrawler
This repo provides a tool to scrawl house info at LianJia.com. The data will be stored in Mysql datatbase. It will be easy to export to CSV or other formates. You also can [sync Mysql to Elasticsearch](https://github.com/siddontang/go-mysql-elasticsearch). In this way, you can use [kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana) to analyse these data.

This tool could collect cellname from each region at first, then you'd like to use these cellnames to learn about onsale, history price, sold information.
